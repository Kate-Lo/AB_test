# AB_test
This project is an interpretation of the results of the AB test, which tests the new payment mechanism of the educational platform.  

During testing of one hypotesis, for the target group was offered a new mechanism for paying for services on site. The control group remained with the basic mechanism.
**The task is to analyze results of experiment and decide wether it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users.**
